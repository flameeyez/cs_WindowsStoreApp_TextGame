fix EntityNPCTemplate, EntityNPCTemplates

when finding an item in a collection (hands, body), should we return a List of matches instead of simply the first one?

fix container issues; figure out how to add to an entity (body? other?)
backpack as a slot item (BodyPart)
- makes sense with equip/remove
- doesn't make sense with 'put item in backpack'
  - has to go through the entire body, when it really only needs to hit container objects
